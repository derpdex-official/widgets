The `@derpdex/widgets` package is an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@derpdex/widgets) of React components used to provide subsets of the DerpDeX functionality in a small and configurable user interface element.

You can customize the theme (colors, fonts, border radius, and more) to match the style of your application. You can also configure your own default token list and optionally set a convenience fee on swaps executed through the widget on your site.
